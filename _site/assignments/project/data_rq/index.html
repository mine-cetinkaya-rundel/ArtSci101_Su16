<h5 id="write-up">Write up</h5>

<p>Download the R Markdown template, fill it out, and submit along with your data file(s).</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <code>
    download.file("http://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/ARTSCI101_Su16/assignments/project/data_rq/data_rq_template.Rmd", destfile = "data_rq.Rmd")
    </code>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="dataset">Dataset</h5>

<p>The dataset can be in any format you like (.RData, .csv, etc.). You must load the dataset into your R Markdown file, so you need to figure out the necessary code to do that. Youâ€™re welcomed to ask about this in office hours or on Sakai, but you might also be able to figure it out yourself doing a bit of Googling or with the help of the librarians at the Data and Visualization Library.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<p>Keep your writing brief and to the point, and be as specific as possible.</p>
