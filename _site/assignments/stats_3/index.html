    <p>A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition. The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition, meaning that the probability of a positive test result when a person actually has the predisposition is 0.99. The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition. What is the probability that a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?</p>

    <p>Lupus is a medical phenomenon where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead see plasma proteins as foreign bodies, leading to a high risk of blood clotting. It is believed that 2% of the population su↵er from this disease. The test is 98% accurate if a person actually has the disease. The test is 74% accurate if a person does not have the disease. There is a line from the Fox television show House that is often used after a patient tests positive for lupus: “It’s never lupus.” Do you think there is truth to this statement? Use appropriate probabilities to support your answer.</p>

    <p>Most companies drug test their employees before they start employment, and sometimes regularly during their employment as well. Suppose that a drug test for an illegal drugs is 97% accurate in the case of a user of that drug, and 92% accurate in the case of a non-user for that drug. 
Suppose also that 5% of the entire population uses that drug. You are the hiring manager at a company that drug tests their employees. You have recently decided to hire a new employee. The prospective employee gets drug tested, and the test comes out to be positive. What is the probability that they are actually a user for the drug?</p>
