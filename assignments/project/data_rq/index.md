**Submission:** Submit on [Sakai]({{ site.sakai }}):

Only one submission per team is sufficient. All team members will be able to view the feedback.

This task is comprised of five parts:

1. Research question(s) - Your research question(s) in an enumerated list
2. Dataset description - A brief description of your dataset
3. Dataset citation - A citation for your dataset
4. Dataset structure - Load the data and show the structure, `str()`, of your dataset
5. Data analysis plan - A brief plan of your data analysis. For now, all you need to include in this section is which variables from the dataset you plan to use, and what associations between them you will investigate to help answer your research question.

### Format

##### Write up

Download the R Markdown template, fill it out, and submit along with your data file(s).

<div class="highlight">
    <code>
    download.file("http://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/ARTSCI101_Su16/assignments/project/data_rq/data_rq_template.Rmd", destfile = "data_rq.Rmd")
    </code>
</div>
<br>

##### Dataset

The dataset can be in any format you like (.RData, .csv, etc.). You must load the dataset into your R Markdown file, so you need to figure out the necessary code to do that. You're welcomed to ask about this in office hours or on Sakai, but you might also be able to figure it out yourself doing a bit of Googling or with the help of the librarians at the Data and Visualization Library.

### Tips

Keep your writing brief and to the point, and be as specific as possible.
